  "bio": "Jamilah is a native of New Haven, Connecticut and graduate of Yale University. After graduation, Jamilah worked at Hartford Youth Scholars Foundation as the Placement Manager, where she placed inner-city middle school students into independent secondary schools around the country. Recognizing larger systemic issues facing Connecticut's education system, Jamilah embarked on a journey to increase the participation of community leaders, parents, and people of color in Connecticutâ€™s education reform movement as the Director of Community Engagement at ConnCAN, a state-level advocacy organization. During her time at ConnCAN, Jamilah began a robust Clergy organizing initiative that garnered major wins for Connecticut's education reform movement and an important bond with Pastor William McCullough that would lead to the creation of FaithActs for Education.",
