  "bio": "I am a Connecticut native born in Danbury to Portuguese immigrants who migrated to the USA between World War I and World War II. I grew up bilingual but found that my ethnic background was a source of prejudice in school. I married young and had three sons. Like many of my time I divorced in my 30s and became a single parent. My work history showed that I did everything I could to support my family and household and I have stories of how I would often turned down for higher paying positions because of my gender. I returned to college to complete my bachelor degree and also a masters degree. In 1987 my youngest son died of suicide by gun and I have been a supporter of gun control and help for teenage suicide prevention since. Now that I am retired I try to support causes that will have good social impact such as the League of Women Voters. As I get older I have more time to reflect on the changes that I have seen especially pertaining to women's rights.",
