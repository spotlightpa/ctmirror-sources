  "bio": "I have been a journalist, weekly newspaper editor and publisher, editorial writer, and freelance writer since 1973. I helped to launch a new weekly newspaper in Old Lyme Connecticut, The Gazette, in 1974, and we eventually purchased a second weekly in Mystic. After selling them in 1982, I became a freelance writer (and stay-at-home dad and helped to build the family house). I wrote opinion pieces, book reviews, travel articles, and feature stories and profiles for newspaper and magazines nationwide, among them The New York Times, The Washington Post, Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, Connecticut Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, The Hartford Courant, and the Baltimore Sun. I also took day jobs to make ends meet. I continue to freelance today, writing for USA Today, CT Mirror, Estuary Magazine and others. I recently stepped down as editor of the East Haddam News, a weekly, after three years in that post and two years before that on the board of directors. I continue to write for the paper. I have covered a wide range of issues over the years: the environment, politics, business, sports, education and the arts. My hobbies include gardening, hiking and biking, bird watching, and cooking.",
