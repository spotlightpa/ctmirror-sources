  "bio": "Duy Nguyen, MSW, Ph.D. is a gerontological social work researcher. His interdisciplinary, collaborative research spans the use of existing data and community-based research to address the health and mental health needs of older Asian Americans. His grant-funded research to date using existing data has revealed how sociocultural factors, especially differences among Asian ethnic groups and the aging process, affect health and mental health service use. This research, relying on cross-sectional samples, has identified the need for targeted, ethnic-specific, and culturally-informed intervention studies to reduce health and mental health disparities in this population. With community-partners, he conducts mixed methods, community-based research that focuses on the social, cultural, and contextual contributors to health, mental health, and help-seeking.\\\n\\\nA Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Dr. Nguyen earned his BA and MSW degrees from Washington University in St. Louis, and his Ph.D. from Columbia University. He has held faculty appointments at Columbia University, New York University and Temple University, where he taught courses in research, statistics, and human behavior. Most recently, he directed the SAMHSA-funded Minority Fellowship Program at the Council on Social Work Education. The initiative increases the number of masterâ€™s and doctoral social workers to address the mental health and substance use needs of racial/ethnic minority populations.",
