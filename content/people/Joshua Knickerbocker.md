  "bio": "I began my career at SCSU over twenty years ago as a male nursing student. Since, I have worked in the pediatric emergency department, pediatric intensive care unit, adult emergency department, quality and safety and pediatric critical care flight nursing. I am a Nurse Practitioner now and a role model for many of my male nursing peers. Throughout my career I have had amazing exposure to many different ethnicities within the New Haven area. Currently, as an Assistant Professor, I am a Co-Director of a Summer Nursing Symposium, which aims at increasing enrollment for under-represented minorities and first-generation college-bound students at SCSU. We will host an annual (starting next week) Summer Nursing Camp, focused on preparing these students for college.",
