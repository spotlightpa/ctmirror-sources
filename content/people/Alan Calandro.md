  "bio": "I have three degrees: two in Business and one in Government but I do not think degrees make one successful. I grew up blue-collar \u2013 my father was a building contractor and I worked for him as a youth and adult. I didn\u2019t know where I was headed, was worried about money/my future, but was always an avid reader (unlike my friends I scored significantly higher on SAT language than math). I began reading news magazines every night after a hard day\u2019s labor. I realized I loved public policy but disliked politics. I naively thought that politicians couldn\u2019t solve various problems because there was not enough information available. I also knew that I would never be affiliated with a party \u2013 they are a big part of the problem. (I\u2019m working on an alternative to this party problem but not sure there is a feasible one.) When I learned that CT (Office of Fiscal Analysis) had a CBO like Washington does, I suddenly got direction: public policy work, without politics, and providing objective information for duly elected people to make better decisions. I was rough and was initially turned down a few times, but I was eventually able to obtain work there and later rose to director where I reformed an array of office products including customer service to all. I made transparency a priority which is why Keith Phaneuf nominated me for the Helen Loy Award. I was lured away to UConn in 2015 to serve as second in command to the head of operations, administration, and finance/budget. I assisted or spearheaded a number of initiatives including reorganization, operational streamlining and of course department dispute resolution. I left UConn in 2020 and have been working on various projects such building a website of objective material and assisting former colleagues with advice/assistance.",
