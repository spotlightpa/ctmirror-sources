She is also a Principal Investigator of the Institute on Collaboration for Health Intervention and Policy and is affiliated with Yale University Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS.

Her research focuses on areas in the US (Connecticut, Minnesota, Ohio) as well as abroad (India, Uganda, Canada). Dr. Ghosh incorporates research into pedagogy by teaching seminars on ‘Health Geography’, ‘Spatial Analysis of Social Issues, and ‘Geographic Information System for Health and Environment’. Dr. Ghosh is also an avid runner and loves to travel.",
