  "bio": "Subira Gordon was born and raised in Jamaica, in a small rural community with a 2 percent literacy rate. Her mother was one of the few people who could read, and Subira quickly realized the value of schooling, as her mother was often asked to assist neighbors with undertakings that required more than a first-grade education.\\\n\\\nUpon graduation from high school, Subira attended Bates College where she earned a bachelor’s degree in history, and spent years afterward organizing workers in Connecticut to advocate for their rights. This was her passageway to political mobilization, policy change and the ins-and-outs of the legislative process, culminating with her role as Executive Director of the Connecticut General Assembly’s Commission on Equity and Opportunity.\\\n\\\nAt the Capitol, Subira worked closely with grassroots advocates and legislators to create equitable solutions for communities of color. Since joining ConnCAN, Subira has led numerous legislative victories focusing on educational equity. Some highlights include minority teacher recruitment and retention, education funding reform and working to ensure that Connecticut’s education system is responsive to the needs of students now and into the future.",
