  "bio": "I work in criminal justice policy with a current focus on policing and public safety. I also direct the Policing, Law, and Policy Clinic at Yale Law School. I previously worked in various law and policy positions in New York City, first at the Corporation Counsel's Office where I advised the Mayor's Office and other City agencies on law and policy matters, and then at the NYC Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice where I served as Senior Counsel. During my time at the Mayor's Office I served on various inter-agency committees, including the Mayor's Task Force on Cannabis Legalization, where I chaired the Subcommittee on Law Enforcement and Social Justice. I was also the principal legal advisor to the City as it worked to relocate juveniles from the City's jail on Rikers Island to a new facility separate from the adult criminal justice system. Prior to my time in City government I was a prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, where I served as a trial attorney. I graduated from Yale Law School in 2010 and Swarthmore College in 2007. I currently reside in Hamden, CT, with my wife and two children.",
