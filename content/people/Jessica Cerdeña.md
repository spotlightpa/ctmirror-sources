  "bio": "Jessica P. Cerde\u00f1a is an MD/PhD Candidate in Medical Anthropology at Yale University. She recently successfully defended her dissertation, \"Onward: An Ethnography of Latina Migrant Motherhood During the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" which examines the powerful ways migrant women accommodate traumatic histories, ongoing structural vulnerability, and the economic and public health crises of the current pandemic. Jes also studies racism in medicine and coined the term \"race-conscious medicine\" in The Lancet to describe clinical practice that emphasizes racism, rather than race, as a determinant of health and illness.",
