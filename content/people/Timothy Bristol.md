  "bio": "My name is Tim Bristol. I'm a 35-year-old Food Truck owner from Stratford CT. I have owned and operated The Melting Truck since 2020. I am a Graduate student in the Political Science Master's program. I currently have a B.S. in Political Science with a minor in History. I am deeply interested in policy analysis, and research into political campaigns. I am currently working on my thesis which will be about Connecticut's Clean elections program. I would love to work for a non-profit organization or research group. I have spent much of my college career doing research on elections, and campaign finance reform. I hope to continue my education and achieve a graduate degree in Political Science and pursue a Ph.D. in Elections and Campaigns.",
