  "bio": "Royette Tavernier Dubar is a developmental psychologist, whose research program examines the link between sleep and psychosocial adjustment. Professor Dubar uses both subjective (e.g., self-report) and objective (e.g., actigraphy) assessments to measure several sleep characteristics, such as sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality. Her interest in psychosocial adjustment spans a wide range of indices, including academic performance, psychological wellbeing, quality of interpersonal relationships, and social media use, and emotional well-being. Her research specifically addresses questions on the link between sleep and psychosocial functioning among adolescents and emerging adults (i.e., college-aged population). \nResearch website: https://www.spalabwesleyan.com/",
